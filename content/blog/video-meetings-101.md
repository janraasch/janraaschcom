## How to prepare properly 101

Let's face it, these online meetings are not going to go away any time soon *and* that is a good thing, if you ask me. In fact I have been working remotely for over 3 years now.

Rarely, if ever, did I look back at the times, I *had to* commute early in the morning through Hamburg (Germany) risking my life on my bike just to get to work. Are there downsides to working remotely? Absolutely, but that is a topic for another blog post (or [book](#book) 📕 😉).

Back on topic: While we are all trapped *remotely*/*at home* we might as well ask ourselves one simple question. Actually I am sure you already asked yourself this question plenty of times during the last few weeks.

> **Can we all improve the way we do online meetings?**

The answer is - you guessed it: »Hell yeah. And, it is easy, too.«

You will find a simple **3-step checklist** at the end of this blog post, which you can write on a post-it note and pin it to your laptop / computer screen. Following the checklist will not take more than 5 - 10 minutes, and you will get good at it - I promise. Soon, this will be a no-brainer. Even sooner, a whooping 100% of your fellow online meeting participants will tahnk you for it. What you will get out of this? Well, a nice, productive and fruitful meeting I would hope. Plus, you can refer you fellow colleagues to the same checklist for the next meeting, so everybody is on the same page.

You may jump to the [👇 checklist](#checklist) right away, but it might seem to easy to be true/trustworthy. That's why we will look at some `Dos` and `Donts` in detail first. Then we'll *break it down* [`👉 #hammer-style`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo). <!-- TODO: Open in new tab. -->

# Donts

Let's focus on the negative first, so we know what to avoid.

If the following list sounds familiar, it's all the more reason you read through this and make yourself aware of the issues - all of which can be avoided easily - once more such that afterwards we can all pledge to avoid these scenarios in the future.

## Mr-X

Not the one from »Resident Evil 2«. Hell no, do not google this!
