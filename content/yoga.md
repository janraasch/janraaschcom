# Yoga 🕉

Dear fellow yoga enthusiast, you came to the right place. Since you are here, I presume you got news that I will be teaching Yoga again very soon. 

While I roll out the mat, i.e. setup a webpage with more details about my upcoming courses, workshops, locations, online / offline, my certificates and everything else 🤩😋😁, please enjoy this (scroll down ⬇️) picture of the cutest dog living in our home 🐕😍. 

Whilst you wait, let me know that you are doing so by sending an email to [satnam@janraasch.com](mailto:satnam@janraasch.com) 📧. This is also a great way to get in touch and start (or even continue) a conversation.

Until then, much love to you.

SAT NAM ☀️.
