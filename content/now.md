**now**

i am currently seeking [new work opportunities for Q2 2024 and beyond][hire-me-url].

[Alex Flatter][alex-flatter-url] excited me about elixir programming, and i am now exploring this area. Phoenix LiveView is a full-stack dream come true :)

i am participating in the [AI Safety Fundamentals][ai-safety-fundamentals-url] course on AI Alignment.

i am working on a lovely photo-sharing application for couples to connect unobtrusively throughout their day, even when apart.

i maintain two open-source design themes: [Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear][hugo-bearblog-url] and [Hugo Product Launch][hugo-product-launch-url].

`TODO: add page on »lovely photo-sharing application« so people may sign up for alpha access and learn more.`

`NOTE: last updated on 23 Feb, 2024. i swear ;). better check deploy logs to be sure...`
