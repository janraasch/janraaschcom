#### open source projects

after taking a break, i'm excited to dive back into open source. still deciding which project to pick up first! here's what i was working on until january 2025:

__ gloves __
a photo sharing app for couples built with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).

__ wichtel app __
a web app for secret santa gift exchanges (called "wichteln" in german) built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

__ bearfeed __
a social feed for you and your close friends. In web arithmetic it is the sum of [FriendFeed](http://blog.friendfeed.com/), [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/) & [Rails 8](https://rubyonrails.org/).
